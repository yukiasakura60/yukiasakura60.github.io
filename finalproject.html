            <p>This is my final project sketch: Smart Pot. It is a plant pot with an LED strip that lets users know when to water their plants. I originally had plans to add a bluetooth speaker but due to time constraints, I decided not to pursue that.</p>

            <p><b>Circuit Operation. </b>The plant pot glows when the plant needs more water. When the plant gets more water, the plant stops glowing. It is all powered by a 12V outlet without the connection of a laptop. The LED strip wraps around the rim of the plant pot.</p>

            <p><b>3D Model of Plant Pot. </b>The plant pot was designed in Rhino and printed with a 3D printer. The rim's height matches the width of the led strip.</p>

            <p><b>Circuit board.</b> When the humidity sensor recognizes a low humidity, the led strip lights glows up.</p>

	<p><b>Arduino Code Snippet. </b>Note that the glowing of the LED is triggered when DHT 11 Humidity Sensor reads a value of less than 40. This is because typically a plant should be between 40%~60% humidity.</p>
